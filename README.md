# Turtle-Race
Turtle race is a program, different number of turtles race with each other and the user bets on it.

Using turtle library, we create different number of turtle using a loop.
Then we give different colours to the turtle, to differentitate them.
Then we asks the user to bet on a turtle, to win the race.
After the race, the program outputs whether the user was right or wrong.
